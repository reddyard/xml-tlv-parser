Simple xml-tlv parser

The project is based on Eli Cohen's solution (https://github.com/echoline/echsml) - thanks for a lightweight xml-parser that doesn't require additional libraries to be installed.
To build, just use ./make.
Once built, the parser test is run with ./test test.xml (please place test.xml at the root of the project).


The tag of each XML node shows the type of data. XML consist of one root element with some child elements. There are two types of data allowed: numeric or text.


Input file example:
 
<START>
	<text>string 1</text>
	<text>string 2</text>
	<text>string 3</text>
	<numeric>205011</numeric>
	<numeric>7</numeric>
</START>

Output TLV File fields:

1  byte - data field type (0x0c for str and 0x0d for num),
1 byte - data field length in bytes, and data field whose size depends on the contents of the xml-tag
